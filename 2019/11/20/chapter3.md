## Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative Grammar
This book is the final version of the widely-circulated 1993 Technical Report that introduces a conception of grammar in which well-formedness is defined as optimality with respect to a ranked set of universal constraints. <br><ul><br><li>Final version of the widely circulated 1993 Technical Report that was the seminal work in Optimality Theory, never before available in book format. <br><li>Serves as an excellent introduction to the principles and practice of Optimality Theory. <br><li>Offers proposals and analytic commentary that suggest many directions for further development for the professional.</li></ul>Content: <br>Chapter 1 Preliminaries (pages 1–10): <br>Chapter 2 Optimality in Grammar: Core Syllabification in Imdlawn Tashlhiyt Berber (pages 14–26): <br>Chapter 3 Generalization?Forms in Domination Hierarchies I: Do Something Only When: Triggering, or the Theory of Economy (pages 27–38): <br>Chapter 4 Generalization?Forms in Domination Hierarchies II: Do Something Except When: Blocking, or the Theory of Profuseness (pages 39–79): <br>Chapter 5 The Construction of Grammar in Optimality Theory (pages 80–99): <br>Chapter 6 Syllable Structure Typology: The CV Theory (pages 105–118): <br>Chapter 7 Constraint Interaction in Lardil Phonology (pages 119–149): <br>Chapter 8 Universal Syllable Theory: Ordinal Construction of C/V and Onset/Coda Licensing Asymmetry (pages 150–202): <br>Chapter 9 Inventory Theory and the Lexicon (pages 207–231): <br>Chapter 10 Foundational Issues and Theory?Comparisons (pages 232–257):

## Nonequilibrium Magnons: Theory, Experiment, and Applications
This much-needed book addresses the concepts, models, experiments and applications of magnons and spin wave in magnetic devices. It fills the gap in the current literature by providing the theoretical and technological framework needed to develop innovative magnetic devices, such as recording devices and sensors. <br /><br />Starting with a historical review of developments in the magnon concept, and including original experimental results, the author presents methods of magnon excitation, and several basic models to describe magnon gas. He includes experiments on Bose-Einstein condensation of non-equilibrium magnons, as well as various applications of a magnon approach.<br /><br />In short, the focus is on<br /><p>1)  new principles of energy transformation from noise to a coherent oscillations (chapters 5,6, appendix G)</p><p>2) new method of computing  - chapter 8.</p><p>Suitable for those who do not work directly with magnetic systems, this book can provide several ideas and analogies that can be useful in their work and research.</p>Content: <br>Chapter 1 Harmonic Oscillators and the Universal Language of Science (pages 1–11): <br>Chapter 2 Magnons in Ferromagnets and Antiferromagnets (pages 13–33): <br>Chapter 3 Relaxation of Magnons (pages 35–57): <br>Chapter 4 Microwave Pumping of Magnons (pages 59–83): <br>Chapter 5 Thermodynamic Description of Strongly Excited Magnon System (pages 85–101): <br>Chapter 6 Bose–Einstein Condensation of Quasi Equilibrium Magnons (pages 103–118): <br>Chapter 7 Magnons in an Ultrathin Film (pages 119–129): <br>Chapter 8 Collective Magnetic Dynamics in Nanoparticles (pages 131–141):
